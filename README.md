Datasets: The datasets used in the paper are stored in the "datasets" and "datasets2" folders. There are two sets of datasets in total, both of which are dedicated to single-category detection of jellyfish and contain a large number of small jellyfish targets. Both of these datasets are partitioned into a training set, a validation set, and a test set at a ratio of 7.5:1.5:1.
